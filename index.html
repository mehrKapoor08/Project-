        <p>Project On Console</p>
        <p>Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, 
            Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting,
             intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>
             <p>The system console, computer console, root console, operator's console, 
                 or simply console is the text entry and display device for system administration messages,
                  particularly those from the BIOS or boot loader, the kernel,
                   from the init system and from the system logger. It is a physical device consisting of 
                   a keyboard and a screen, and traditionally is a text terminal, but may also be a graphical terminal.
                    System consoles are generalized to computer terminals, which are abstracted respectively by virtual 
                    consoles and terminal emulators. Today communication with system consoles is generally done abstractly, 
                    via the standard streams (stdin, stdout, and stderr), but there may be system-specific interfaces, 
                    for example those used by the system kernel.
